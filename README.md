# sysadmin

###

Hello all! 

I am not sure a seasonal developer. I am security enthusiast person. The code I used in this folder was copied from [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/); one of my favourite site to visit and learn. I am trying to read the flow of code and try to hack the same. 

Apart from that, I am going to update any good resources I find to make the sysadmin's life easier. Because it is one of my dream in my "Bucket List"! I am hopeful that this resource could be beneficial to me and newbies :) 

This will content LAMP Stack, WordPress, Server, Firewall, Hardening etc..
