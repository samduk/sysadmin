# sysadmin

###

Hello there! 

I am not a seasonal developer therefore, I borrowed many code from [Tutorials Point](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/); one of my favourite site to drop-by and learn.

I named this folder sysadmin, because I fancy about this job quite sometime now. Therefore, I thought it is important for me to take many small steps :)

I am very thankful for [Tibetan Computer Resource Centre](http://tibet.net) for arranging many advance trainings!
